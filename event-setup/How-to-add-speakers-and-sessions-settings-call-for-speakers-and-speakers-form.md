## Call for Speakers 
Next, you can start to add  description for the `Call for Speakers` into the **Annoucement** box, set its start/end time and select the
timezone. Here, you can also decide whether you want to display the `Call for Speakers` publicly or make private. If you set the `Call
for Speakers` as private, proposals can only be submitted via the private link.
