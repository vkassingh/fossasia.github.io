6. Once `Attendee Form` has been turned on, you will see two other tables as below:

- **Information to Collect**: A list of additional questions provided by **Eventyay** for you to choose from. If you want to include any of these questions, slide the controller in front of each question to `Include` or `Require`.  

- **Add Custom Form Field**: This feature allows you to add in any other questions to collect more answers/information from your attendees.

**Notice**: If you want to use the `Custom Form Field`, simply input the question into `Field Name` and select the type of information you want to collect (`Text` or `Number`) from the dropdown menu.
