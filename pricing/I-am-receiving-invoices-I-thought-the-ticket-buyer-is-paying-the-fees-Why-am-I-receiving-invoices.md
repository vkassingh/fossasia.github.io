# I am receiving invoices, I thought the ticket buyer is paying the fees. Why am I receiving invoices?

We send you invoices to collect the service fees paid by your attendees for the tickets you sold for events. When you sell a ticket you receive the money directly into your account on PayPal, Stripe or an offline payment method. This includes our service fees that your attendees pay.
