# Where can I submit a bug report or feature request?

There are different repositories for different components of the [Open Event software suite](https://github.com/fossasia?q=open-event) that is powering [eventyay.com](https://eventyay.com). If you are unsure where to post a bug report or feature request just create an issue in the [Open Event Frontend](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend/issues) issue tracker, please. If this is related to another component we will move the issue where it belongs. In order to post issues you need a GitHub login.

If you would like to talk to developers and contributors about issues you can also visit our [Gitter.im chat](https://gitter.im/fossasia/open-event) or [Telegram channel here](https://t.me/eventyay).
