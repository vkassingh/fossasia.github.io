# How can I contact the developers?

There are different ways to contact maintainers and developers of the [Open Event software suite](https://github.com/fossasia?q=open-event) that powers [eventyay.com](https://eventyay.com). 

Usually developers are available on our [Gitter.im chat](https://gitter.im/fossasia/open-event) or [Telegram channel here](https://t.me/eventyay). Please consider that contributors live in different time zones and will respond to inquiries depending on their availability.
