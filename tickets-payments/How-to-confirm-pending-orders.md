# How to confirm pending orders?

Everytime an attendee places a ticket, that ticket will be accounted as `placed` ticket.

Therefore, tickets need to be confirmed before they can be accounted as sales. This will help organisers manage their sales and check if the payments have gone through or not. In order to confirm pending orders, please follow these steps: 

## Step 1: Log in
On Evenyay.com, log in using your `username` and `password`.

 Select `tickets`, this will allow you to view your `order status`, `total orders` and `total sales`. As we can see, a placed ticket has been accounted under `PENDING`. So we need to confirm that ticket onced payment is received.
